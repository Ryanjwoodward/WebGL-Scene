# WebGL-Scene
CST310 school project with Asher Shores

When Running the code, the common folder from cst310 will be necessary. 
All the referenced files from the 'common' folder are listed within the HTMl script sources.

Currently the projects furthest progress is contained on the fourth-branch off of 'main' in this repository: https://github.com/Ryanjwoodward/WebGL-Scene
